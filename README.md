Social Coding For Fresca Web Dev

Hi,

This is a Fresca Web Dev repo for sharing snippets and patterns of HTML, CSS, Javascript and JSP markup and code.

The idea is that we can use this to share code and markup that we've written for our projects that we think is so
awesome we had to share it. Then others can use this code in their own projects.

Or, if others think it can be improved and want to use the power of Github, they can fork, update/refactor/improve,
and resubmit. Hopefully leading to construcitve criticism, lively debate, and a whole lot of learning and self-
improvement.

Initially this is going to be trialled by the members of Team Jamie, although if other teams want to join in 
I'm sure they can be accomodated.

Martin
